I have taken elective courses in Thermodynamics, Robotics, and Renewable Energy Systems. Robotics was the most fascinating course for me, and I plan to focus on this area for my master's degree. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Automation and Control Systems, especially in the context of Smart Manufacturing and IoT. However, I am not very enthusiastic about subjects that delve deeply into theoretical physics or advanced calculus. I prefer courses that involve hands-on projects and the application of engineering principles to real-world problems.\"\n",

I am also very interested in Neuroscience, particularly in Neurodegenerative Diseases and their treatments. On the other hand, I am not very fond of courses that focus heavily on molecular biology or genetics. I enjoy practical courses that involve patient interaction and clinical practices.\"\n",
