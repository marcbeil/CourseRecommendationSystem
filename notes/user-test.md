# User Testing Guide for Course Recommendation System

## Introduction
Welcome, and thank you for participating in this user test! Today, we’ll be exploring a new course recommendation tool designed to help you find university courses tailored to your interests and study situation. I will guide you through each step and provide any necessary instructions.

### Overview of the Tool
- This tool helps you discover university courses by allowing you to input your preferences in natural language.
- You can specify topics you’re interested in, topics you want to exclude, language preferences, ECTS credits, previously taken courses, schools / departments and more.
- Make sure to describe your current study situation, including your main subject, minors, semester, study level, and any other relevant details.
- Think about what your ideal course would look like—consider describing multiple types of courses if you'd like.

### Task 1: Describing Your Ideal Course
1. **Think about your perfect course**: Consider your current study situation and what topics should be included. Should it build on previous courses you've taken? Are there specific ECTS credits or prerequisites you'd prefer?
2. **Use the tool**: Enter your thoughts and preferences into the tool as if you were describing your ideal course(s).
3. **Talk through your process**: As you use the tool, please describe out loud what you are doing and why. This will help us understand your thought process and identify any areas of confusion or friction.
4. **Review two lists of recommendations**: The tool will provide two lists of course recommendations, each generated using a different ranking algorithm. Compare these two lists to your initial ideas:
   - **List 1**: Generated using Ranking Algorithm A.
   - **List 2**: Generated using Ranking Algorithm B.
5. **Compare results**: How well do the results from each list match your ideal course description? Which list seems more relevant? Are there any surprises or courses that stand out?

### Task 2: Recalling a Previous Course
1. **Think about a course you've already taken**: Recall a specific course from a previous semester that you enjoyed or found valuable.
2. **Describe it using the tool**: Enter a description of that course into the tool.
3. **Find the course in both lists**: Check if that course appears in either of the two recommended lists. Note its rank and relevance in each list.
4. **Evaluate the effectiveness of both lists**: Based on this exercise, which list (List 1 or List 2) provided a more accurate ranking of the course? Why do you think one was better than the other?

### Task 3: Feedback Survey
- After using the tool, please take a few minutes to fill out a short survey about your experience. The survey includes 10 questions focused on usability, accuracy, relevance, and overall satisfaction.
- Your honest feedback is essential for us to improve the tool.

### Conclusion
- **Discussion and Feedback**: Once the survey is complete, we’ll have a brief discussion about your overall experience with both lists. Feel free to share any additional thoughts, recommendations for improvement, or positive aspects you noticed.

Thank you again for your participation! Your input is invaluable in making this tool more effective and user-friendly.
